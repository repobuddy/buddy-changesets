# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

## Skill Augmentations

When reading any `SKILL.md` file, always check whether a `SKILL.local.md` exists in the same directory. If it does, treat its contents as additional instructions that extend the base skill. Local augmentations take precedence over the base skill where they conflict.

## Commit Discipline

**Auto-commit rule:** When a unit of work is complete and verified, commit it immediately — do not wait for the user to ask. Batching multiple units into one commit, or finishing all work before committing, are both violations of this rule.

**Unit of work:** one coherent, independently revertable change — one domain's refactor, one feature, one bugfix, one test suite expansion for one concern, one config change. Never two unrelated concerns in the same commit. A TDD red-green-refactor cycle alone is not a commit boundary; commit when the full intended change is complete and tests pass. If the working tree has unrelated changes, leave them unstaged — commit the current unit first, then continue.

- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- One concern per commit; never batch unrelated changes
- Stage only files for this unit: `git add <files>`, then verify with `git diff --cached`
- Never use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git add -p` (interactive commands agents cannot run)
- Never commit with red tests; run validation commands first

## What This Repo Is

A pnpm monorepo for the buddy-changesets plugin — skills for AI agents to work with
[changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets), the versioning and changelog tool
for JavaScript/TypeScript packages.

```text
apps/web/                    Astro Starlight documentation site, deployed to GitHub Pages
packages/buddy-changesets/   the plugin: plugin.json, vendor manifests, skills
```

The plugin is distributed from its subdirectory in this repository (git source and the
marketplace catalogs at the repository root). It is not published to npm, so
`packages/buddy-changesets` stays `private`.

## Build and Test

The plugin is pure markdown — nothing to build or test. The only build in the repo is the
docs site.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm web dev      # run the docs site
pnpm build        # turbo build — builds apps/web
```

## Adding a New Skill

Create `packages/buddy-changesets/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: "One sentence trigger description — WHAT it does, WHEN to invoke it, key situations it handles."
---

# Skill Title

...content...
```

For sub-skills (called by other skills, not triggered by user situation), prefix the description with `"Internal skill:"` to prevent accidental activation.

## Skill Design Principles

- **Decisions over documentation** — encode what to decide and how, not reference material the model already knows
- **Narrow and composable** — one workflow per skill; user-facing skills match situations, sub-skills are called explicitly by other skills
- **No baked-in opinions** — detect the user's setup at runtime rather than assuming a specific stack

A new user-facing skill also needs a page under `apps/web/src/content/docs/skills/` and a
sidebar entry in `apps/web/astro.config.mjs`.
